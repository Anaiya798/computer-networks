The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very
deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell
very slowly,to see anything :
then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards
and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps
and pictures hung upon pegs.
